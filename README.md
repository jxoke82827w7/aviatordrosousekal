## Aviator Game Guide

### Understanding the Mechanics

Aviator is a game of luck and strategy. The plane takes off with a
multiplier starting at 1x. As the plane continues to fly, the multiplier
increases gradually. The goal is to cash out your bet before the plane
crashes, which can happen randomly at any time.

### Betting Strategies

-   **Low-Risk Strategy:** Bet small amounts and cash out early at low
    multipliers, such as 1.2x to 1.5x.
-   **High-Risk Strategy:** Bet larger amounts and wait for higher
    multipliers, but be aware of the potential for losing your bet if
    the plane crashes early.
-   **Double Bet Strategy:** Place two bets simultaneously. Cash out one
    bet early to cover your initial bet, and let the other bet ride for
    higher multipliers.
